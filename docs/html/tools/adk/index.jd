<p>The Accessory Development Kit (ADK) is a reference implementation for hardware manufacturers and
hobbyists to use as a starting point for building accessories for Android. Each ADK release is
provided with source code and hardware specifications to make the process of developing your own
accessories easier. Creating new and alternative hardware based on the ADK is encouraged!</p>

<p>Android accessories can be audio docking stations, exercise machines, personal medical testing
devices, weather stations, or any other external hardware device that adds to the functionality of
Android.</p>

<p>Accessories use the Android Open Accessory (AOA) protocol to communicate with Android
devices, over USB cable or through a Bluetooth connection. If you are building an accessory for
Android devices, make sure you review the information below to understand about how to implement the
AOA protocol.</p>

<p>The following sections provide more information about the Android Accessory Development Kits, how
to use them, and how to get started building your own accessories for Android.</p>
